TODO: Needs implementation:
    - Points are sometimes out of bounds
Change Log:
11/02/20
    - Added IO file to handle reading and writing from files.
    - Implemented CombineTrials
    - Moved Panels from inside Util to PSU.Group2
    - Cleaned ActionListeners code alot by removing redundant try/catch statements
    - Added Analysis to panels
    - Added AnalysisListener to ActionListeners
    - Started implementing Object file TestResults.java to handle calculations. This was done in an effort to keep the ActionListener code as clean as possible
11/16/20
    - Finished TestResuts *Unless more calculations are wanted.
    - Added Graph Panel But have not implemented.
    - Finished Analysis Panel except for adding Menuitem GraphPanels to menubar

//Brief program notes:

The program goes from CyclistReactionTime(Main) -> GUIHandler (Interface) -> MainMenu (Panels) -> Some Action listener -> To wherever the user chooses.

When a Button is pushed, it finds that button in it's respective action listener, then preforms the action associated.

Every Panel has it's own action listener.

Writing to file code://///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    //This is setup code in the IO java file

    public BufferedWriter setupWriter(String FilePath, boolean append)
            throws FileNotFoundException {      //This will set up a file writer

        FileOutputStream Fwriter = new FileOutputStream(FilePath, append);
        OutputStreamWriter outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(Fwriter, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

        return new BufferedWriter(outputStreamWriter);
    }

    public void write(String vals, BufferedWriter writer) throws IOException {
        writer.append(vals);                    //This writes the info to it's respective file associated with the writer.
        writer.newLine();
    }

    //This is how it would be used <----------------------------------------------------------
    IO setup = new IO();

    BufferedWriter writer = setup.setupWriter("RunInstructions.txt", true);

    setup.write(var); //writer.append can also be used, this is just a append with a newline to remove repetition

Reading from file code:///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    IO setup = new IO();        //Setting up Input output streams

    BufferedReader Reader = setup.setupReader("RunInstructions.txt");
    String Line;

    while ((Line = Reader.readLine()) != null) { //variables to be set here }
